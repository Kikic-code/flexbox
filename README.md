# Flexbox Project

This is the **first project** where I learned and practiced **Flexbox**.  
The only purpose of this project was to apply the concepts of **HTML, CSS, and Flexbox properties**.  

Itâ€™s a part of my learning journey, and it helped me build confidence in layout design using Flexbox.

- Styling using **CSS**
- Mastering **Flexbox properties** for responsive layouts

## Next Steps
This was just a practice project. The next big milestone is the landing page where I will combine these concepts.
